Dear friends,

We are starting a climate change action project—currently named Spaceship Earth—that we’ve probably mentioned to you in person (and if we haven’t, we think your interests & skillsets are relevant and hope you’re interested in hearing more).
Our intention is to organize a group of folks to commit collectively to monthly concrete actions <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> that improve our individual impact on the planet and grow environmental and community sustainability.
We want to embody and inspire the changes we see as critical to humanity’s survival <sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup> — and to support each other in this often-daunting effort <sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>.

The MVP entails:
1) a well-researched list of actions, aiming for monthly cadence for 10-12 total
2) a website with information about the project, allowing signups and showcasing our impact
3) a mailing list for participants

We’re hoping to wrap all this in a toolkit that makes it easy for anyone to adapt the project to their own network, whether to further climate action, organize a reading group, setup a neighborhood cleanup, or any other collective effort.
In-person gatherings and broader outreach are also worth considering. We would love your help with any of the associated tasks, and in order of importance:

- research and content: writing about, ordering, and scoping the actions, convincing folks why they matter
- web dev/admin: website and mailing list mechanics
- UI/UX design
- general enthusiasm/support for the project
- any other ideas for engagement & impact

All of us have full lives with various priorities.
We are prioritizing this project in ours and setting a weekly work meeting on Thursday nights, alternating locations in SF and Oakland—we hope you can join for some and welcome any form/level of involvement.
If you are excited and have the bandwidth to contribute, please let us know in what form! 

Thanks,
Igor & Stacey

"Act always as if the future of the universe depended on what you did, while laughing at yourself for thinking that whatever you do makes any difference.”

 <a name="footnote1">1</a>: examples: inventory your home and transportation energy use, volunteer your time for a local non-profit, plan your donation budget and where it’s going, get involved in local politics/issues, give up meat for a month, etc.

<a name="footnote2">2</a>: In a crude attempt to summarize all our readings and conversations on these topics, squashing all nuance and “well but what abouts”: Human civilization is totally fucked drastically impacts our planetary ecosystem.
Humans are struggling to understand and model the full scope of these impacts and the spectrum of possible outcomes for our future.
Some of these are irreversible and already destroying plant, animal, and human livelihoods.
For others, we can still change course so as to not totally fuck up the Earth.
But that requires each one of us to reevaluate our engrained behavior patterns and potentially do a lot of hard work.
Common responses to this situation include: 1) it’s not a serious/real problem and other people/science/the government will take care of it, 2) my individual-scale actions won’t make any difference, and 3) it’s too hard to change my behavior/where do I even start.
We know 1) and 2) are bullshit and want to make 3) easier.
More eloquent inspiration: Work that Reconnects, Project Drawdown.

<a name="footnote3">3</a>: Observations: it’s really hard to give up, say, eating meat or frequent plane travel with zero understanding—and sometimes with active criticism, ridicule, and opposition—from your friends, family, and extended community.
Default society enforces and fetishizes meat-eating and flying (c.f. bacon, foodie culture, probably your grandmother’s cooking, the tourism industry, instagram, status signaling by where you’ve traveled).
Hypothesis: behavior change would be much easier within a dedicated group to witness, encourage, support, and celebrate the collective positive impact of our actions.
